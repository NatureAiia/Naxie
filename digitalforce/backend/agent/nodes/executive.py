Determine the user's intent from the following message, and reply.

Recent context:

Determine if the user is asking you to start a task, create a goal, execute something, or analyze data. If yes, it requires the Manager's attention.
If the user is approving a previously proposed plan, mark approval_status as "approved". If rejecting, mark "rejected". Otherwise "none".
If the user is explicitly providing credentials, a password, a 2FA code, or telling you to inherently update the 'Truth Bucket' for an account, provide the account name you detect, and the specific text to append to their auth_data bucket.
