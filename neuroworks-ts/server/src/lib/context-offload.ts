// Symbolic tool-output offload — when a step's result carries a large string
// field (a scraped page body, extracted doc text, a long file read, a long
// ollama.generate draft), archive the FULL text to disk once and replace the
// field with a short preview + a pointer. Every existing consumer downstream
// (buildEvidenceCatalog, synth's evidence builder, compactStepSummary) already
// truncates independently at its own cutoff — so today the full text is
// silently discarded, over and over, at N different points, unrecoverable
// once gone. This collapses that to ONE archival point with a full copy kept
// on disk, and shrinks what rides through every subsequent LLM call in the
// same plan — a 5-step research plan today carries every prior step's raw
// scrape through steps 2..5's prompts even though only the final synth needs
// the full text.
//
// Correctness: a later step's args can reference an earlier step's field
// VERBATIM (`vault.write content: "$step_2.text"`) — if that field had been
// silently truncated, the write would land corrupted with no error anywhere.
// recoverFullText() is the fix: resolveValue() in agent.ts runs every
// resolved string through it, so an explicit reference always gets the real
// bytes back off disk, while everything else (evidence catalogs, synth,
// rescue summaries) keeps seeing the short preview it already expected.
//
// Adapted from TencentDB Agent Memory's "symbolic short-term memory" concept
// (offload full logs to refs/*.md, keep a compact pointer in context) —
// scoped down to fit here: no Mermaid graph, no node_id backend pipeline,
// just a preview-string-with-pointer swap that's a drop-in replacement for
// the field's old string value.
