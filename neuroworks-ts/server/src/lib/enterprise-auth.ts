// Enterprise-mode gate — OFF by default, toggled with NEUROWORKS_ENTERPRISE_MODE=1.
//
// The problem this closes: lib/access.ts's requireLayer() explicitly lets
// token-less requests through ("machine/operator context"), and only 7 of
// 46+ route groups call requireLayer() at all. origin-guard.ts is a real
// defense against BROWSER attacks (DNS rebinding, cross-origin POST) but its
// own logic exempts any request with no Origin header — exactly what a
// non-browser client (curl, a script, a network-adjacent attacker) sends.
// Together: fine for "runs on my own machine, never network-exposed" (the
// current default), but the moment this API is reachable from a wider
// network, there is effectively no authentication left on ~39 of 46 route
// groups, including shell access, credentials, and money.
//
// This middleware is the fix, designed to be a single flip: off changes
// nothing (today's local behaviour, unchanged); on requires every non-exempt
// request to prove it's either a logged-in human (session token — already
// works, see lib/access.ts) or a trusted machine (a "machine:full"-scoped
// API key — see lib/api-keys.ts, reusing the same infrastructure the
// external dispatch surface already relies on).
//
// Same-machine requests are exempt regardless of the flag — verified via the
// OS-level socket remoteAddress (not a spoofable header), so local peers/
// workers on the same host keep working with zero extra config. A peer or
// worker on a DIFFERENT host needs a "machine:full" key attached as
// `Authorization: Bearer nw_...` once enterprise mode is on — that wiring is
// NOT done for you across every internal caller (peers.ts has 7+ scattered
// fetch() call sites); mint a key via POST /api/dispatch-keys and attach it
// by hand to any cross-host peer config until that's centralized.
