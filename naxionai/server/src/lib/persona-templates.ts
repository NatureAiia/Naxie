//   • Curated — for known built-in personas (Researcher, etc.) we override
//     with hand-crafted templates whose plans pre-wire the right primitive
//     (e.g. research.multiperspective) so the user gets one-click access to
//     the persona's signature tool without paying the planner LLM cost.
