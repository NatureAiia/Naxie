# NeuroWorks container.
#
# Based on the official Playwright image because the server's doc/OCR/browser
# pipeline (playwright, canvas, tesseract) needs the system libs + a real
# Chromium — the slim node image can't run those.
#
# PRODUCTION SHAPE (single port): the web SPA is BUILT once (vite build →
# web/dist) and the API server serves those minified, fingerprinted assets
# itself. No Vite dev server runs in production. Everything is on ONE port
# (7471), bound to 0.0.0.0 so the published port is reachable. The API runs via
# tsx (no watch) — the same runtime the operator uses locally, minus the churn.
#
# STORAGE: all mutable state lives under two paths that docker-compose mounts as
# named volumes, so nothing the agent writes is trapped in the container layer:
#   /app/.neuroworks   → jobs journal, users/sessions, data sources, department
#                        data, hand-off runs, personas, schedules
#   /data/vault        → the Obsidian "second brain" (VAULT_PATH)
