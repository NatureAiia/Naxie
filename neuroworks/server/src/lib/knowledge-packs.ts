## Key Considerations for Zimbabwe Operations
- Regulatory compliance is critical — ensure all automated workflows align with local laws
- Dual-currency environment (USD/ZWL) requires careful financial handling
- Mobile-first strategy recommended given high smartphone penetration
- Internet connectivity varies between urban and rural areas

      content: `# FinTech Regulatory Framework — Zimbabwe

## Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Guidelines
- All FinTech operators must register with RBZ
- Mobile money operators require a Payment Systems licence
- Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements apply to all digital financial services
- Transaction limits apply to mobile money (tiered based on KYC level)

## Key Regulations
- **Banking Act [Chapter 24:20]** — governs all banking operations
- **National Payment Systems Act [Chapter 24:23]** — governs mobile money and digital payments
- **Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act** — AML/CFT compliance mandatory
- **Data Protection Act** — governs customer data handling

## Common Compliance Pain Points
1. Transaction reconciliation across multiple payment rails
2. Agent network management and liquidity monitoring
3. Financial literacy content for end-users
4. Reporting to RBZ — monthly statistical returns
5. Audit trail requirements for all transactions

## Mobile Money Ecosystem
- **EcoCash** — dominant player (Econet), ~8M users
- **OneMoney** — NetOne, ~2M users
- **Telecash** — Telecel, ~500K users
- Interoperability via RBZ's shared switching infrastructure

## Key Risks
- Liquidity risk at agent level
- Fraud — SIM swap, social engineering
- Regulatory changes (RBZ policy shifts)
- Foreign currency shortages affecting settlement

### 2. Agent Network Management
Monitor and optimise the agent network for mobile money operators.
- Agent float position monitoring
- Rebalancing recommendations
- Agent performance scoring and tiering
- Compliance check reminders (licence renewal, KYC refreshes)

### 3. Financial Literacy Content
Generate and distribute financial education content in Shona/Ndebele/English.
- Savings tips tailored to informal sector workers
- Digital payments safety guides
- Small business bookkeeping basics
- Cross-border remittance guidance

### 4. Regulatory Reporting
Automate RBZ reporting requirements.
- Monthly statistical returns
- Transaction volume/value summaries
- Suspicious transaction reports (STR)
- Annual compliance reviews

### 5. Customer Onboarding Automation
Streamline KYC and account opening processes.
- Document verification workflows

      content: `# Agriculture Sector — Zimbabwe Knowledge Pack

## Sector Structure
- **Smallholder farmers** (~70% of population) — average 2-5 hectares
- **Commercial farms** — larger operations, tobacco, horticulture, livestock
- **Command Agriculture** — government input scheme for maize and other staples
- **Pfumvudza/Intwasa** — conservation agriculture program for smallholders

## Key Subsectors
1. **Tobacco** — largest export earner, auction system (TIMB)
2. **Cotton** — Cottco, ginning and marketing board
3. **Maize** — staple food, Grain Marketing Board (GMB)
4. **Sugar** — Triangle and Hippo Valley estates
5. **Horticulture** — citrus, avocados, flowers (export market)
6. **Livestock** — beef, dairy, poultry, pigs, goats
7. **Soybeans** — growing demand for cooking oil and stockfeed

## Key Challenges
- Climate variability — droughts and floods
- Input financing — access to seed, fertiliser, chemicals
- Market access — price discovery, transport logistics
- Extension services — limited reach to smallholders
- Land tenure security — 99-year leases, A1/A2 farm models

## Digital Opportunities
- Weather-indexed insurance products
- Mobile-based extension services
- Input tracking and supply chain visibility
- Market price information systems
- Tractor and equipment sharing platforms

## Regulatory Bodies
- **Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development**
- **Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB)**
- **Grain Marketing Board (GMB)** — strategic grain reserve
- **Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA)**
- **Zimbabwe Fertiliser Company (ZFC)**
- **Seed Co** — major seed supplier
